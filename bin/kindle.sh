# Command line utility to send attachments to your kindle
# It supports sending a PDF in both regular form and with the convert option
# and sending to the regular (@kindle.com) or free Kindle mail (@free.kindle.com)

# The only argument it has is the name of the file to send. It will detect if
# it is a pdf and treat it accordingly.

## Preferences
# If true, send one version with pdf as-is, another with 'convert' subject
# else, just send the pdf version
SEND_PDF_BOTH_VERSIONS=true

# if true, sends file to @free.kindle.com instead of @kindle.com
SEND_TO_FREE_MAIL=false
